# How to control Turnigy TGY-S518D servo motor 


This datasheet was created for those who want to use this cheap Chineese clone of Robotis Dynamixel MX-28. 

Actually, there aren't any official datasheet for this servo motor on the Internet (at least in non-Chineese segment). The only info about the "Chinamixel" that I could find is provided [here].
